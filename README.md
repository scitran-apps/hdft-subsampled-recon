## hdft-subsampled-recon

Build context for a [Flywheel compatible Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) for the HDFT Subsampled Recon algorithm from Schneider Lab, University of Pittsburgh.

This **sample** code computes a transformation of multi-shell diffusion weighted data to a set of Spherical Harmonic coefficients. Outputs 4D Spherical Harmonic coefficient data. This is a first step in the Schneider Lab HDFT diffusion reconstruction process.
